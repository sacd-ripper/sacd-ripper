## Introduction ##

SACD includes various copy protection measures of which the most prominent is Pit Signal Processing (PSP). The first two generations of Sony's Playstation 3 (PS3) game console are capable of reading SACD ScarletBook and bypass the copy protection.

This software makes use of the PS3 and gives you the option to backup your precious SACDs to a 1:1 decrypted ISO or you can choose to extract the individual tracks to DSDIFF (DFF) or DSF which allows you to create a [DSD disc](http://ps3sacd.com/dsddiscguide.html).

### Getting Started ###

I advise you to thoroughly read the [instructions](http://sacd-ripper.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/readme) before you get started. In short you will need a SACD [compatible](http://ps3sacd.com/faq.html#_Toc180147566) PS3, and last but not least it needs to have a firmware smaller or equal to 3.55 else you won't be able to run the software. And no, a downgrade for a firmware higher than 3.55 is NOT available.

After weeks of testing (thank you Patrick!) and fixing bugs it's safe to say we've officially reached a stable version which makes SACD-Ripper version 0.21 our beta. From now on make sure you are running (version number should be displayed at startup) at least version 0.21 before reporting new bugs.
