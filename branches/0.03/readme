Installation

Make sure you have a PS3 model with SACD compatible player. For more information
on what model specifically go to: http://ps3sacd.com/faq.html#_Toc180147566

You need to install a custom firmware to be able to rip SACDs. At this time of
writing the PS3 firmware has not been cracked for firmware 3.60 and upwards. So
in order to install the correct firmware you'll have to make sure your firmware
is lower or equal to 3.55.

The custom firmware that is needed must incorporate a LV1 patch to allow access
to the System Manager services of GameOS. A firmware which incorporates that is
the OtherOS++ firmware. More information can be found here:
http://gitbrew.org/otheros/

Custom Firmware installation steps:

  1: Plug a USB stick into your computer
  2: Create a folder in the root of the USB stick called PS3
  3: Create a folder inside the PS3 folder called UPDATE
  4: Download the 3.55 OtherOS++ firmware (http://gitbrew.org/otheros/)
  5: Move PS3UPDAT.PUP to the directory UPDATE that you just created on the USB
     stick
  6: Plug the USB stick into your PS3
  7: Navigate to Settings Tab
  8: Choose System Update
  9: Choose Update via Storage Media
 10: It will say it found Version 3.55
 11: Choose OK
 12: Accept Conditions and Follow the instructions
   
If the steps above did not work for you, then you are probably on 3.55 already.
You will have to do a recovery menu mode installation:

  1: Plug a USB stick into your computer
  2: Create a folder in the root of the USB stick called PS3
  3: Create a folder inside the PS3 folder called UPDATE
  4: Download the 3.55 OtherOS++ firmware (http://gitbrew.org/otheros/)
  5: Move PS3UPDAT.PUP to the directory UPDATE that you just created on the USB
     stick
  6: Plug the USB stick into your PS3
  7: Power down the PS3 through the menu
  8: Now press and HOLD the power button, the system will startup and shutdown
     again
  9: Release the power button, then press & HOLD power again, you’ll hear one
     beep
     followed by two consecutive beeps
 10: Release power then follow the on-screen instructions. You’re now in the
     recovery menu
 11: Connect the USB device and select "System Update."
 12: Accept Conditions and Follow the instructions
